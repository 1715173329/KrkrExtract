## Note
Since I have no time on this project, KrkrExtract will only focus on xp3-like archive unpack.  
KrkrExtract will not foucs on modified krkr engines.  
If you have any needs, pls develop by yourself.  


## Encrypted(protected) executable file
Actually, If I add some bypass supports in this project, It's very difficult to support make sure they will not conflict with other parts.  
So you're sure that the executable file is protected, pls remove the protection or just patch the binary and then use KrkrExtract to unpack archives.

## Separated tools
I provide many separated tools to you.  
If krkrExtract is not able to process some files corrently, you should try seperated tools first.

## More English docs?
I'm trying to do this.  
Since I almostly have no time on open source project, I'm not sure when can I upload more docs about my tools.

## Bug report
Since your can get pdb symbol from here, I think it is more easy to debug this project.
 

## Any differences between krkr2 and krkrz?
My answer is NO DIFFERECES.  
krkrz supports msvc while krkr2 can only built by bcb.  
Some companies modified krkrz so we need more steps to unpack archives.  

## Why universal patch not compatible with krkr2?  
krkr2 use bcb(C++ Builder, legency version...) as default compiler.   
bcb will make code more complex so sometimes it's more difficult to analyze code automatically, plus, KrkrExtract can pack archives for krkr2.  

## How to use & How to ...  
I know maybe have many questions about KrkrExtract, Pls see the website below firstly.

## Any problem about repack?  
Why not try to use universal patch?  


## Other krkr Project  
AlphaMovie Decoder:

## 64Bit Version 
useless:)  
I've removed all source codes about 64bit version.  
I don't think any company will use 64bit version.
