## Note
KrkrExtract has stopped developing.  
If you have any needs, pls develop by yourself.  

## Any differences between krkr2 and krkrz?
My answer is NO DIFFERECES.  
krkrz supports msvc while krkr2 can only built by bcb.  
Some companies modified krkrz so we need more steps to unpack archives.  

## Why universal patch compatible with krkr2?  
krkr2 use bcb(C++ Builder, legency version...) as default compiler.   
bcb will make code more complex so sometimes it's more difficult to analyze code automatically, plus, KrkrExtract can pack archives for krkr2.  

## How to use & How to ...

## 64Bit Version 
useless:)  
I've removed all source codes about 64bit version.  
I don't think any company will use 64bit version.
